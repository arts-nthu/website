Taking family photos at a photo studio is a common and celebrated event. The way families dress up usually projects their desires. The old studio setting depicts a longing of a far-away time. Liao Chi-Yu’s recent video works used hand-painted settings to construct a time and space depicting various situations, while interlacing a narrative of fiction and reality.
 

Invited by the Arts Center of National Tsing Hua University, three single-channel videos “Dog”, “Turtle”, “Bird”, and a series of power installations completed this year were exhibited. The theme revolved around the experience and imagination of connection with the animals - through myth, singing, oral histories, and other forms of interior monologue, narrating the "existence that cannot be seen”, such as death, reincarnation, and all forms of love.
 

Liao used video works as the main creative medium, focusing on physical experience, memories, and emotions. She adopted open narratives to explore different levels of feelings in life and delicately depicts the casual moments between people. 
 

Liao Chi-Yu recently won the special prize of the UNITEXT Kaunas Biennale Competition Jury in Lithuania and was invited by international exhibitions such as the Bonn Video Art Biennale in Germany. Recent solo exhibitions include "Way Out Beyond" at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, “River Still, River Goes” at VT Artsalon in Taipei, and “Sanssoucci Park and River” at the a.m. space art gallery in Hong Kong.
