開幕茶會:6月23日(六) 身體器官的細胞在一定時間內會漸漸的汰換成新的細胞，每個器官的細胞完全汰換週期不同，有長有短。但是在某個時間點，身體裡的細胞會和過去的某個時間自己身體裡的細胞完全不同。我們不再是我們自己——至少細胞完全不一樣了。 【You Are What You Eat】 Artist: Chia Ying Lin Time: Wed. 30th May 2018 - Wed. 20th June 2018 Reception: Sat. 23th June 2018 It is inevitable that the cells of bodies and organs will gradually replace by the new ones in a certain time.
