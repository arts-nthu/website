## 簡介

西班牙藝術家Juanjo Novella即將於今年內動工在清大南校園大草原設置一件優雅的公共藝術，造形為一片紫荊樹葉，一片早就存在於校園樹種的樹葉。此項國際公共藝術設置計畫是集結合併校內多項建築物的公共藝術經費，計有六棟建物: 教學大樓新建工程、多功能運動館新建工程、學人宿舍新建工程、創新育成中心新建工程、清華實驗室新建工程、第一招待所B棟新建工程。藝術家於2016年初便親自到校園收集可提供創作靈感的自然界植物葉片，帶回西班牙繼續思考創作的可行性，希望能啟發多層次的意涵與聯想，在草原上的葉片邀請人們能與其互動，大自然與生活有密切的聯接。作品的絕對感和寂靜感應能喚起民眾積極的人生價值觀。這是件不容易施作的大型戶外公共藝術，材質是厚重的鋼板，量體巨大卻能帶來無限輕盈的感覺(節錄自賴小秋策展文字)。


## About LEAF
Juanjo Novella, a Spanish artist, has set up an elegant public architectonic art,LEAF, at the southern Campus Green in NTHU on 8th Dec. 2017 . This public architectonic art is like the shape of  Bauhinia leaves, which are already planted on campus. The artist came to NTHU campus collecting leaves which can provide inspiration for his creation in person in 2016. He brought back all the leaves he collected back to Spain, thinking about the possibility of creating the public art creation. Also, he hopes the public architectonic art, LEAF, can inspire a complexity of meanings and association of ideas. Sincerely inviting all the guests to interact with this elegant creation, he also wishes people to appreciate this large, outdoor public architectonic art, which is quite difficult to set up. The texture of LEAF is hard steel plate; however, though LEAF looks large, the leaf shape makes people have a graceful association, just like a leaf dancing in the air.
