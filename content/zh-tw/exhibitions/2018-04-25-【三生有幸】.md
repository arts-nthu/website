藝術家面對面:4/28(六)-4/29(日) 清華藝集至本年度【三生有幸】已是團隊第四年度的作品呈現。創作者決定要舉辦一場好像遊樂場般的藝術展覽，今年場域遷移至風雲樓四樓。這個在清華歷史中一直扮演大型用膳的空間，即將旋身為一個盛滿了藝術思維的場域。其中每一個轉折，都充滿作者們的心思和冒險精神。 【Blessing/San Sheng Yu Hsing】 2018 Tsing-Hua Art Salon Annual Exhibition Artist: Faculty of Tsing-Hua Art Salon Time: 25th April 2018-23th May 2018 Face to face with Artist: Sat. 28th April - Sun. 29th April Blessing/San Sheng Yu Hsing is the fourth artworks exhibition of Tsing-Hua Art Salon so far.
