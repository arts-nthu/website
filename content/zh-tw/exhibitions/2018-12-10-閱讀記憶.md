We wish this exhibition can let us recall the memories and feelings which we once pursued or have already forgotten but somehow deeply hide in our bosoms. Lee’s artworks talk about human’s memories towards time and space, and by creating them, she wants to explore the core of life. Yen-Hua Lee started "Book Plan” since 2006. She considered books home of the words, and collects antique books from WWI and WWII. By having a conversation with the authors who passed way through the book contents and thinking those books as her old friends, Lee explores the essence of book, book order, and book flipping, then create her artworks. She blends the pictures which she draws from her visual memories and words from books, and those pictures and books tell their stories by their own ways, and interact as if they are talking to their friends. To Lee, it is one of ways to tell the memories, describing memories about time and space which can be flipped through by such “Book Plan”. No matter those memories are collective or momentary, memories of life are both a beginning and an end. “Book Plan” has more than 20 painting creation, which are all created by Lee, who collects those memories of time and space. “Home Plan” is the extension of “Book Plan”, which is based on the concept of painting and sculpture, using multiple media devices to show the relationship between space and time in a home, and wish to explore the life memories of human minds and home space. Time flies and life as well. Only by pursuing the spiritual perception from our hearts can we brood essential memories of time and space. Yen-Hua Lee’s exquisite artworks bring us eternal spiritual calling on our memories.
