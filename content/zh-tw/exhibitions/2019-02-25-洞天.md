2.25(一)10:30茶會 2.25(一)11:15 藝術家面對面 平日12:00-19:00 / 周末12:00-17:00 /國定假日２２８和平紀念日休館 藝術家董明龍曾說：「讓創作回歸生命原鄉，山、天、洞、溪，是我幼時的回憶。……石頭是自然所賜予的素材，是我接觸最久熟悉之物……嘗試在重裡減輕，轉化出虛與實的永恆。」，花蓮廣闊無際的大自然孕育藝術家，幼時即對石刻產生濃厚興趣，年長後拜師許禮憲藝術家於其工作室進行國手培訓，於全國競賽中奪得冠軍及入選「石刻職類」國家選手代表。目前教學相長，於北藝大每學期教授石材與造型、石雕、工作室機具實習與維安等課程。極為特別的是，這位藝術家因為自身創作需求而研發、設計與製作個人雕刻工具，毫不藏私地樂與同業分享，也嘉惠許多藝術創作者。 「洞天」展覽系列作品涵蓋石雕與木雕，藝術家將源自於兒時記憶花蓮風貌山天洞溪的具象光景，賦予自身的情感，充分思索之後轉化而為抽象造型，直立柱狀屹立不搖、向上延伸、無窮追尋，虛實並濟的內涵既象徵起始與光明，也讓人聯想到花蓮自然風貌。藝術家勤奮不懈、刻苦耐勞的創作精神態度如同溫潤石材般深沉而內斂，凝聚簡練美感與原始生命力，喚起我們對虚實雕塑空間，真切的感受與共鳴(賴小秋撰稿)。 **【Cave vs Sky －MingLung Tung's Solo Exhibition】** Organizer: NTHU Arts Center Mon. 25th Feb. 2019 - Sun. 24th Mar. 2019 Venue: Arts Center Exhibition Hall 10:30 Mon. 25th Feb. Reception 11:15 Mon. 25th Feb. Face to face with the artist Weekdays 12:00-19:00 / Weekend 12:00-17:00 / National Holiday 228 Peace Memorial Day closed Artist Minglung Tung once said, “Let the creation return to its life hometown. Mountains, sky, caves and streams are my childhood memories. Stone is the material given by Nature, the thing that I have been familiar with for a long time. I try to relieve from heavy things, transforming the eternity of emptiness and reality.” The vast and endless nature in Hualien breeds Minglung Tung. Since childhood, Tung had a strong interest in stone carving. When he grew elder, Lixian Xu, an artist that Tung learned art from, had trained Tung in his studio. Tung won a championship in a national competition and was selected as a representative of "stone carving". At present, Tung teaches in “Stone and Styling”, “Stone Carving”, “Machinery operations and Security” and other courses in Taipei National University of the Arts. Especially, Tung invents, designs and produced personal carving tools and he generously shares with his peers and benefits other artists. **“Cave vs Sky”** exhibition artworks includes stone sculpture and wood sculpture. Artist Minglung Tung transforms the scenery which derives from his childhood memories from mountains, sky, caves and streams in Hualien to abstract shapes through pondering. The erect columnar stands straight, extends upward, pursues infinitely, which shows the connotation of emptiness and reality, and it not only symbolizes both the beginning and the lightness but reminiscent the natural features of Hualien. Minglung Tung’s diligent and hardworking spirit in creating is as deep and introverted as the stone, which condensed succinct beauty and original vitality, arousing our true feelings and resonance with emptiness and reality of the sculpture.
