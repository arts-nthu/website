開幕日期：2018年3月5日（一）10:30 藝術家面對面：2018年3月5日（一）11:15 城市風景聯展呈現四位當代藝術家帶給芸芸眾生們視覺體悟與影像上的延伸思考，與當下的生活環境產生對話，做更深層的反芻。王鼎元的三系列作品【台北愛丁堡動物園計畫】【黑洞】【重複行為者】直指人心，應和長期以來全球各城市保護動物團體對動物園所發出強烈批判與行動，切入動保核心的癥結，探索人們內心應認同的根本議題。汪正翔在此展中呈現的【那些台灣不美的風景】，有六對作品是將拍攝過的台灣違和影像再投影於另一個地點，讓觀者可以清楚意識到投影前後的變化差異，引起關注的是藝術家所選擇帶有批判性的風景，與再次投影的場所均是我們熟悉不過的生活周遭深具缺陷景像，違和風景投影重疊後呈現出多重色彩與空間賦予我們對當下的生活環境更多的人文思維與想像。羅宇唐【City Texture 城市肌理】捕捉完整的城市力量影像，汗水淋漓的都會工人勤奮地建造出現代城市的光景，都會工人彷彿城市肌理如辛勤的螞蟻般孜孜矻矻地建構我們安身之所。楊奇融是此展挖掘的新星此展應是其踏入藝術界的首次正式聯展，請到展場來一探其【小偷日記】究竟!(節自賴小秋策展文字)

They wish people can think about their lives in the act when appreciating the arts, and go deeper by pondering the connection between arts and their own lives. Ding Yuan Wang’s three art works, Project of Taipei Edinburgh Zoo, Blackhole and Repeater, explore the issue of animals in the zoo. His art works echo with the criticism and action from animal conservation group. Cheng Hsiang Wang presents his work, My Scenery Only For You, he takes photos of streets and scenery of Taiwan, and most of them are quite controversial. Those photos show the defects in the familiar scene we see every day in Taiwan, and that’s the reason why he called his photos controversial. He would like to provide humanity spirits and imagination for his audience by overlapping two images to present multiple colors and spaces. Yu Tang Lo catches the pictures of industrious workers in the cities, who are like hard-working ants, endeavoring to build up a modern society in his art work, City Texture. Chi Jung Yang says modestly that his art work, Worn Diary, captures and records the crossing point of time and space, leading his audience thinking about the meaning and spirits of time and space in a moment. City View is a great exhibition for audience to appreciate these four artists' novel ideas and it will definitely give its audience a brand-new feeling!
